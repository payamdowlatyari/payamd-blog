title: "The Art of Living Consciously: The Power of Awareness to Transform Everyday Life"
excerpt: "Living consciously means seeking to be aware of everything that bears on our actions, purposes, values, and goals - and behaving in accordance with that which we see and know. In The Art of Living Consciously, Dr. Nathaniel Branden takes us into new territory, exploring the actions of our minds when they are operating as our life and well-being require - and also when they are not."

I am a student of Dr. Brandon. Like other books I have read from the author, his main focus was on self-esteem and self-confidence. He points out that our destructing behaviors are rooted in our unconscious way of living. Likewise, we can easily avoid many mistakes only by exercising to bring awareness to our actions. He introduces a technique that has been amazingly beneficial to many of his clients in decades of psychotherapy practice which is sentence completion. For example, "If I bring 5% more awareness to my profession, [and one should continue with everything that is grammatically correct as many as possible]".
