In this book, Huntington provides a new way of analyzing how the world order is defined in terms of power and influence over other countries. After the Cold War ended at the end of the twentieth century, many political analysts believed that the clash between superpowers was over and the future of the world would be unipolar with the Western civilizations being hegemonic. However, the author of this book shows how we are entering a new area where civilizations compete over hegemony.
