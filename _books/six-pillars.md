Everybody should read this book, especially people with low self-esteem. Most psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and anger come from a lack of self-esteem. During a person's mental development, most babies between the age of one and three years old received millions of signals from other people regarding their weaknesses. Because children make mistakes and others correct them, they think they are bad. In the next stages of development, as what Piage introduced as the preoperational, concrete, and formal operational stages, the bad feeling of a child must be recovered by positive messages from parents, friends, and the educational system. Otherwise, the person could suffer from a low-esteem. In this book, Dr. Brandon provides a scientific and empirical method for building one's self-esteem as an adult.
