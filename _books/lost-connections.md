This is an amazing book about human behaviors resulting from our lifestyle that might eventually cause depression in people in the modern world. Studies show that a large number of people, who suffer from depression, have a severe lack of ability to reason and think logically. Hari mentions interesting facts about our animal side and how disconnection from nature can cause depressed moods. Although, in my opinion, the author is a bit too much against medication therapy, some of the topics he says would help people who suffer from depression.
