One of the finest books I've ever read. Harari explains the most complex philosophical concepts in a simple and understandable language. His point of view on ideological and religious beliefs is completely neutral, fair, and based on logic, evidence, and scientific approach rather than prejudices. In this book, the author discusses 21 fundamental topics such as religion, education, politics, democracy, nationalism, technology, and so on. He argues the way people's lives are impacted by fixed ideas, mindsets, and schools of thought. Also, he points out how sepians evolved and how their evolution shaped society, individuals, and cultures. Harari's arguments and conclusions are based upon reality, science, and open-mindedness, and he defends the liberty, freedom, and dignity of a human being.
