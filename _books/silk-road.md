This book is one of the best writings about the origins and convergence of modern civilization in Eurasia, where the Silk Road plays a significant role. Frankopan shows the importance of trade and interaction between peoples with different cultures, religions, and ethnicities from China to India, Persia, North Africa, and Europe. As a Persian, I was particularly interested in learning about the impact of Persian culture in history as a corridor between the West and East when the Silk Road was the main trade route in the world.
