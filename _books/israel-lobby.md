I have always wanted to know the reason why the US provides so much support for Israel even when that support may end up being against its interests. I think Mearsheimer demonstrates how the Israeli lobby has influenced American politicians since the establishment of the state of Israel. He correctly explains that almost all those efforts were made legally and his argument is not founded on old anti-semitic conspiracy theories. In contrast, it is based on facts and evidence. Understanding that helps Americans and also Israelis to be aware that not all those policies supported by the US were in the best interests of Israel. They have not brought security to the region and were against the peace process in the Middle East.
