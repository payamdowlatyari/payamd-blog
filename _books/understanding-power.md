I admire Chomsky as an activist, linguist, philosopher, and scholar. He has been of the rare public figures in the United States that has the knowledge and capacity to connect the dots on different events by fact-checking rather than what the media tries to make us believe. Chomsky looks at the processes throughout history rather than single events and reveals the underlying reasons and intentions of the politicians based on many factors including but not limited to history, ideology, facts retrieved from different reliable sources such as outdated official documents belonging to intelligence agencies, foreign newspapers, and firsthand data from people who were directly involved in circumstances. This book is based on multiple questions and answer sessions that took place in the late 20th and early 21st centuries on many interesting topics linked to power and international relations, history, concepts such as Anarchism, Socialism, and Capitalism, and the influence of the media in spreading misinformation, disinformation to serve the power.
