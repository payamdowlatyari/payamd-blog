Dr Brandon is one of my favorite psychologists and authors. I read this book after his masterpiece the Six Pillars of Self Esteem. His view of love is very humanistic and natural. He does not think that love is is something unattainable but he believes that we need to be ready for it. He mentions some common patterns of unhealthy love and as I was expecting almost all of those are related to a person's self esteem and self confidence. I think reading this book would help young people to recognize unhealthy behaviors in relationships and opens their eyes.
