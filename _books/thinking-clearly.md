This book is about common fallacies we face in our daily lives. The author discusses 99 ways of thinking better and not following the illusions that have become norms in society. Each mini essay is about 2 to 3 pages long and well-structured. The author is not a university professor but uses many sources and scientific studies with proper citations. The most significant aspect of the book is the author's use of simple language for demonstrating complicated concepts.
