I believe Sapians is a masterpiece and a must-read for whoever wants to know how homo-sepians evolved and human civilization developed for thousands or even millions of years. The book is well-written and easy to follow. The author's analysis and explanations are based on scientific evidence and historical facts. In Sepians, Harari emphasizes the importance of narratives and storytelling in shaping and strengthening human relations and establishing early civilizations. He analyzes the role of religions in communicating and expanding those stories and forming extensive groups of people having similar attitudes and sharing the same beliefs and behaviors. History shows us how cultures grew because of interaction between homo-sepians and even people gossiping played a crucial role in creating, telling, and repeating those stories over and over and fictional stories that helped them become united and function organically as societies and nationalities. In brief and in my opinion, the gist of this book is what differentiated human beings from other animals were the power of storytelling. Storytelling is what made homo-sepians the most dominant creatures on earth.
