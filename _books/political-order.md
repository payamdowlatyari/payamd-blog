The Origins of Political Order is a comprehensive overview of how human societies functioned before the emergence of states. Similarly, Fukuyama explains the formation of the early state in China, showing how tribalism gives rise to state building. It was interesting to learn about how wars and military competition contribute to state-building. The author demonstrates the influence of religions in the evolution of states and concepts such as rule by law, rule of law, and accountable government.
