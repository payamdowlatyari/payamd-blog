Dr. Milani is an outstanding scholar and Iranian professor at Stanford University. In this book, he authors a detailed and analytical biography of the last monarch of Iran who had to flee the country after the government's overthrow in 1979 which led to the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Milani carefully describes the story from different perspectives and based on reliable sources and has a fair attitude for admiring or criticizing the Shah's actions as a head of state for 37 years. This book narrates the public and personal life of the Shah in parallel so the readers have a better understanding of the Shah's situations at critical points during his reign.
