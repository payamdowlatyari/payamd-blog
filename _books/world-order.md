Henry Kissinger is one of the most well-known and controversial politicians and scholars in the United States. His realistic approach to changing international relations was practical and innovative when he was the secretary of state in Nixon's administration. Also, as an academic, he has extensive knowledge of other countries. I personally learned a lot from this book, specifically from chapters related to Iran, the Middle East, and China. However, I think Kissinger is not entirely honest about things that occurred in Vietnam, Cuba, and other third-world countries in Asia, and Latin America. Although he is not lying about the events, he tries to rationalize the U.S.'s violent acts in those countries.
