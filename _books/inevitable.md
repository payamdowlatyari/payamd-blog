Kevin Kelly is a brilliant and creative author and journalist. In this book, he shares his expansive vision and futuristic wisdom about 12 inevitable trends in the world of technology. Kelly points out how robots can change our future in a good way such that people won't have to do dangerous, physical, and difficult tasks because those are done easily by smart robots. Autonomous vehicles will reduce the number of car accidents down to almost zero, and Artificial intelligence will make the healthcare service much more reliable with the help of self-tracking devices (wearables). The emergence of clouds by different companies will create the cloud and every person can carry all human knowledge and information and access it at any time. Of course, he believes modern technology can be used in criminal and non-ethical ways too but the benefits would be in favor of peace and improvement of human lives.
