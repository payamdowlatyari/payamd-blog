Taking Responsibility is another well-written and practical book by Nathaniel Brandon whose efforts and teachings have been guiding many people including myself to have a better understanding of life and learn a more satisfactory way of living. The most significant lesson I learned from this book, was the fact that taking responsibility is, without any doubt, our only road to freedom and liberty. The author has a famous quote that states, "Nobody is coming!". That means, I should take care of myself and I am responsible for my own physical and mental well-being always and forever.
