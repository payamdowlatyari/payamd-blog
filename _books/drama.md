Children with relatively high intelligence may suffer more during their childhood. As a result, they have to deal with anxiety and depression later and during their adulthood. In this book, Alice Miller explains how sensitive children can damage psychologically by decent parents whose behaviors are quite normal in society. What parents and other caregivers must know is that an infant lives in a totally different world than grown-ups.
