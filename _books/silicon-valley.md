As a software engineer working at a start-up in Silicon Valley, this book gave me valuable insight. The author pays good attention to the psychological issues of the most intelligent and successful individuals in the nation. Lack of emotional intelligence and selfishness cause serious issues in the working environment. Unhealthy competitions demand employees who work like machines with a limited sense of empathy for others. Goal-oriented engineers and self-centered CEOs walk in the streets of the San Francisco Bay Area in front of hundreds of homeless people every day without even noticing them.
