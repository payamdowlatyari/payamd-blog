title: "Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century"
excerpt: "Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner has been acclaimed as the most influential educational theorist since John Dewey. His ideas about intelligence and creativity have revolutionized our thinking. In his groundbreaking 1983 book Frames of Mind , Howard Gardner first introduced the theory of multiple intelligences, which posits that intelligence is more than a single property of the human mind."

The idea of Multiple Intelligences has been one of the twentieth century's most influential and controversial theories in cognitive psychology. Before introducing such an idea, almost everyone including teachers, parents, students, and even psychologists and other scientists like biologists and anthropologists thought there was only one type of intelligence that could be measured by IQ tests. Professor Gardner, who is a Harvard professor and researcher, shows that we as animals and human beings can have a wide range of intelligence. Unlike what most psychometricians believe, IQ tests could only show one or two parts of our intelligence which are mathematical and linguistics. Interestingly, one must be relatively well in those areas in order to have success in school. In fact, the importance of IQ is when a child faces issues in learning. In his book, Gardner explains why we should provide opportunities for children to grow abilities in multiple areas. I personally think the book was very informative and well written but the last two chapters were a bit vague and the author repeated some of the concepts much more than needed.
