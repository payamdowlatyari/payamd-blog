Hannah Arendt is one of the most influential thinkers and political philosophers of the twentieth century who had the opportunity to be a student of Martin Heidegger and also the horrible experience of WWII as a German Jew. Despite all the bitterness Arendt has about the Nazis, in this book, she provides a pure and impartial argument on how a normal person does evil things without being fully aware of the consequences of their decisions. She strongly criticizes the court and believes that although Eichmann committed those crimes, the jurisdiction follows a propaganda objective.
