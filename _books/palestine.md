I have been following the news about the war and conflicts in Palestine for years but have found not too many writers who can describe and analyze the roots and history of this issue as Rashid Kalidi has done in this book. The problem is Palestine is one of the most complicated issues of the twentieth century and, in my opinion, the modern world. Kahlidi had a family and personal experience dealing with the war in Lebanon and believes in a two-state solution and persuing peace through diplomacy. I agree with the author that Palestinians should create political institutions worldwide and raise their voice. War will make things worse for both parties.
