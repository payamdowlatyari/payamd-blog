Solaris is another masterpiece by Tarkovsky and one of the earliest Si-Fi/Drama movies full of artistic scenes and poetic moments. There aren't many directors like Tarkovsky that can capture the deepest human feelings in frames with so few or no words. Solaris, like the other movies by Tarkovsky, has a deep sense of mystery in almost all the scenes, in details, and overall flow of the story. The dialogues and monologues add more sophistication to the scenario and challenge its audience. It surprises you many times, makes you think about knowns and finally leaves you with many philosophical question and unexplored side of your psychee.
This film is about love, time, space, the universe, and many other ideas that vaguely exist in our minds. However, they have very different meanings for each person. The psychologist, who is initially going to discover the reason for the mysterious events that happened on that secret planet, like all other individuals who lived there, will eventually be stuck in an infinite loop of his darkest memories. Later, he found some explanations for the issue that was useful enough to free himself but his observations and analysis are not quite meaningful to others who have not been in the same situation.
