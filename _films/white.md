I think the openning and closing of this film is the best between all three the way that the author/director surprises the audience with unusual and uncanny shots. The film starts with showing a suitcase in the airport, then shifts to a Paris divorce court where a Polish barber is talking with the judge similar to a scene in Blue. After a series of events after the divorce, the guy who was an immigrant in Paris with no money, comes back to Poland his home country for the sake of survival. Sometime later, the camera shows the guy, who now became a successful person in France, visits his ex-wife in prison and sees her through her cell window. As she gestures to him that she wants him back, the guy starts to cry like a lost child who just found his mother.
