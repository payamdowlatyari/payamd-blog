Like its title, the film is about the life of a brother and sister at a very young age. In its first hour, Bergman takes you to the mysterious life of a wealthy family that owns a theatre at Christmastime. Alexander and Fanny lived in a colorful house with caring parents Emilie and Oscar and their grandparents, uncles, and workers until Oscar died unexpectedly. As a result, Emilie thinks she needs support from a strong man to raise her children and marries a cold and prejudiced bishop who brutally abuses her kids and herself. Bergman made this film based on the true story of his life. In his film, he reveals the contrast between the life of the two groups and uses every element to highlight his points. The furniture and interior design of the two homes would tell you much more than anything else about the feeling and beliefs of the residents. The dialogues are written carefully and adapted to characters and situations.
