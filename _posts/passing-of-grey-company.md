I have read several books lately that completely altered my view about the way education systems are designed. I have been familiar with the idea of multiple intelligence since a few years ago but after reading another book by professor Howard Gardner on the topic of intelligence, I became more certain that the issue I noticed in many societies and school systems was real.

In recent years, I had the opportunity to work with very successful and talented individuals in academia and industrial settings. I realized while those people had outstanding proficiency in their specializations, many of them had severe difficulties in other areas such as interpersonal relationships. Because they focused only on school work and didn't pay enough attention to the other aspects of their lives, they didn't develop their cognitive abilities according to their age and position. Ironically, the problem becomes more visible when they try to apply logic and reasoning in their personal life. Logical fallacies are very common when they make life-changing decisions because their beliefs and emotions take over the rational mind.

While the problem would have numerous consequences for a person and society, I think we could easily avoid them. To bypass issues that are caused by illogical thinking we should teach children how to think about their thinking and assess their way of reasoning. The tools to do so are the laws of identity and non-contradiction. The law of identity says things are what they are. A is A. Using the law of identity, causality could be defined. Causality means that things must act following their nature. The law of non-contradiction states that nothing can be A and not A. In other words, nothing can be true and false at the same time.

When people lie to themselves, they are violating one of those fundamental laws of logic. There are many forms of logical fallacies that are constructed on top of those basics. Those fallacies include but are not limited to over-generalization, projection, mixing reality with causality, or using correlation for proving an incident was caused by another incident while they had nothing to do with one another. In my opinion, these fundamentals should be taken seriously like teaching language or mathematics. Fundamentals of logic could be much more useful in the life of an individual than, for instance, history or geography.
